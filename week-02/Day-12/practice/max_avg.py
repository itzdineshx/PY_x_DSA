# Maximum Average Subarray I
"""
Algorithm – Sliding Window
1. Compute the sum of the first k elements.
2. Set this as the current maximum average.
3. Slide the window from index k to n-1:
- Add the current element to the sum.
- Remove the element that moves out of the window.
- Update the maximum average.
4. Return the maximum average.
